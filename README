A highly opinionated configuration setup

Just a collection of handy configuration settings I've found over the years, collated into one simple setup script

To get everything started, do the following:
1) Copy setup.cfg.template to setup.cfg
2) Configure setup.cfg accordingly
3) Run ./setup.sh

If anything gets updated:
1) Run ./setup.sh again

Of course, this stuff is as-is and I'm just using it for myself, i.e. it's not meant for distribution.  Just figured I'd leave it up.

If you do want to play around, I'd modify the vim bundles.  They are a tad customzied for myself.
